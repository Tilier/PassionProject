            <p><h3>HTML is powerful.</h5> It rules all. Without it, you wouldn’t be on this site reading this. In fact, online school would probably be done for. Every site you see is made with HTML. Every. Single. One. You may ask, “what about website builders, like Wix, Shopify, or SquareSpace?” Well, those website builders only make it easier. Normally, you would have to program a site in HTML, probably CSS, and possibly PHP, Javascript, and JSON. These website builders only generate all of the code (plus possible SQL) for you, so that you don’t have to write the code.
</p>
        <p class="indent">Here’s an example — right-click anywhere on this site. Then hit “inspect” or, for Safari, “inspect element.” A bar will appear, probably on the bottom or right side of the screen, showing all of the code that went into that site. So, you can see all of the code I wrote to build this page.</p>
        <p class="indent">Then, go to <a style="--bg:rgb(63,63,63)">photographyphiles.com,</a> a site built with Wix, and inspect. All of the code you see was generated by Wix — but it’s still in HTML, CSS, etc.
</p>
        <p class="indent">Basically, without HTML, there would be no sites.</p>
        <p class="indent">But what about CSS? Javascript? PHP?</p>
        <p class="indent">They both need HTML to survive. They both use what was coded in HTML.</p>
        <p class="indent">In the next lesson, you’ll learn some basics of HTML.</p>
